  \begin{itemize}
  \item <2->
    ASP is an approach to \alert{declarative problem solving},
    combining
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a rich yet simple modeling language
    \item with high-performance solving capacities
    \end{itemize}
    % tailored to Knowledge Representation and Reasoning % (KRR)
  \item <3-> ASP has its roots in
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (deductive) databases
    \item logic programming (with negation)
    \item (logic-based) knowledge representation and (nonmonotonic) reasoning
    \item constraint solving (in particular, SATisfiability testing)
    \end{itemize}
  \item <4-6>
    ASP allows for solving all search problems in $NP$ (and $NP^{NP}$)
    \\in a uniform way % (being more compact than SAT)
  \item <5-6>
    ASP is versatile as reflected by the ASP solver \alert{\textit{clasp}},
    winning\\ first places at ASP, CASC, MISC, PB, and SAT competitions
  \item <6-6> ASP embraces many emerging application areas
  \end{itemize}
